# List-2 count_evens
# Return the number of even ints in the given array. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.

def count_evens(nums):
  count=0
  for i in nums:
    if i%2==0:
      count += 1
  return count
  
# List-2 big_diff
# Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array. 
# Note: the built-in min(v1, v2) and max(v1, v2) functions return the smaller or larger of two values.

def big_diff(nums):
  if len(nums) ==1:
    return 0
  else:
    return max(nums)-min(nums)

# List-2 centered_average
# Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, 
# except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. 
# If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. 
# Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.

def centered_average(nums):
  order = sorted(nums)
  if len(nums)%2==1:
    return order[(len(nums)-1)/2]
  else:
    return (order[len(nums)/2-1]+order[len(nums)/2])/2
    
# List-2 sum13
# Return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. 
# Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so it does not count and numbers that come immediately after a 13 also do not count.

def sum13(nums):
  unlucky = []
  length = len(nums)
  if len(nums) == 1:
    return 0
  if len(nums) == 2 and nums[0]==13 and nums[1]==13:
    return 0
  if len(nums) >= 2:
    if nums[length-1] == 13:
      unlucky = unlucky + [13]
    for i in range(length-1):
      if nums[i] == 13:
        unlucky = unlucky + [nums[i]] + [nums[i+1]]
  return sum(nums) - sum(unlucky)
  
# List-2 sum67
# Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 7 
# (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). Return 0 for no numbers.

# List-2 has22
# Given an array of ints, return True if the array contains a 2 next to a 2 somewhere.

def has22(nums):
  if len(nums) >= 2:
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
      if nums[i] == 2 and nums[i+1] == 2:
        return True
  return False
