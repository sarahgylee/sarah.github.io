# Logic-1 cigar_party
# When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive.
# Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars.
# Return True if the party with the given values is successful, or False otherwise.

def cigar_party(cigars, is_weekend):
  if is_weekend and cigars >= 40:
    return True
  else:
    return (cigars >= 40 and cigars <= 60)
    
# Logic-1 date_fashion
# You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter "you" is the stylishness of your clothes, 
# in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes.
# The result getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes.
# If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). 
# With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

def date_fashion(you, date):
  if you<=2 or date <=2:
    return 0
  elif you >= 8 or date >= 8:
    return 2
  else:
    return 1

# Logic-1 squirrel_play
# The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). 
# Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. 
# Given an int temperature and a boolean is_summer, return True if the squirrels play and False otherwise.

def squirrel_play(temp, is_summer):
  if is_summer:
    return (temp >= 60 and temp <= 100)
  else:
    return (temp >= 60 and temp <= 90)
    
# Logic-1 caught_speeding
# You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. 
# Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. 
# If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. 
# If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.
